# go-axioms
Axioms Go client. Secure your Go APIs using Axioms authentication and authorization.

This sample runs on the beego framework.
To install beego run:
`go get github.com/astaxie/beego`

We also use the beego development tool `bee`, to install:
`go get github.com/beego/bee`

**NOTE:** Bee tool only works in the specified GOPATH so either set your GOPATH where you want it to be or make sure you create your project in the current GOPATH

Once bee is installed, run `bee run` inside the `go-axioms` directory to build the project and run the server.
